{"name":"Mail.Ru Parking widget","tagline":"Android widget to monitor Mail.Ru parking status.","body":"### What is it?\r\nRecently @Mail.Ru Group has moved to a new office building with its own underground parking. Also the service to monitor free parking places was created as a web page. I decided to make an Android widget to monitor parking status on our mobile devices.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Display free parking places with refresh date.\r\n* Process tap and double-tap on widget. By defaults to force update or to show details respectively.\r\n* Show last fetched data, timestamps of data update and refresh, fetched raw JSON.\r\n* Autoupdate data respecting internet availability. Battery is not draining while offline.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is useful feature called \"Smart update\". The update frequency varies depending on time of day:\r\n* On workdays widget updates once per hour.\r\n* On workdays within `hot hours' (from 9 till 12 am) widget updates each 15 minutes.\r\n* On holidays widget does not update at all.\r\n\r\nP.S. Application icon has been temporarily taken from Agent application and colored to blue. Hope, it will be changed to its own soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nYou may contact me via e-mails: kalmar.trash@mail.ru or a.marchuk@corp.mail.ru\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
