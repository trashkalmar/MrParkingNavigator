{"name":"Mail.Ru Parking Navigator","tagline":"Android app to navigate on Mail.Ru parking and to monitor free places.","body":"### What is it?\r\nRecently @Mail.Ru Group has moved to a new office building with its own underground parking. Also the service to monitor free parking places was created as a web page. I decided to make an Android app to navigate on the parking and to monitor free places with our mobile devices.\r\n\r\nNow with this app you can easily find the place on the map on arrival. And you need not the parking card to remember where is your car, when you are about to go home!\r\nAlso, owners of Sony SmartWatch 2 can fully control an application, including navigate on map using the wrist device!\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Displays free parking places with refresh date.\r\n* Processes tap and double-tap on widget. By defaults to show navigator or to force update respectively.\r\n* Shows last fetched data, timestamps of data update and refresh, fetched raw JSON.\r\n* Autoupdates data respecting internet availability. Battery is not draining while offline.\r\n* **Remembers parking place, shows it on the floor map and remembers place on the widget.**\r\n* The floor number and elevator side are remembered too.\r\n* **Support for Sony SmartWatch 2.**\r\n\r\nAlso, there is useful feature called \"Smart update\". The update frequency varies depending on time of day:\r\n* On workdays widget updates once per hour.\r\n* On workdays within `hot hours' (from 9 till 12 am) widget updates each 15 minutes.\r\n* On holidays widget does not update at all.\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nYou may contact me via e-mails: kalmar.trash@mail.ru or a.marchuk@corp.mail.ru\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
